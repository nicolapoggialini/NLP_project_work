# Stance classification

This project is focused on tackling the task of stance classification using the SemEval 2016 dataset (task 6).<br><br>
This repository contains:
- in data folder, semEval2016.zip: zip containing the data used in this project;
- stance_classification.ipynb: the notebook in which all the experiments have been done;
- report.pdf: a report in which all the work done is described;
- presentation.pptx: a presentation that sums up the project.

The final model is too big to be loaded here. It can be found at the following link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WHTA4I_yQnXOwP4qAW0e-aS2HruQNOW0/view?usp=share_link and has to be imported manually (e.g. from Google Drive) to replicate the final results without going through the training.
